*** This is a work in progress ***

My Cellar is a web application created to a wine enthusiast who wants to know what he has in stock in two different cellars. It allows him to enter the name of the wine, winery, vintage, producing region, type of wine, and number of bottles.

# What I have learned

While I was building My Cellar I have learned the fundamentals of MVC architecture, and how to create and connect to a MongoDB database. During development (still going on), I tried to follow a workflow based on pull requests, even though I was working alone, to practice using git and GitHub.  

# Source

This project began as a todo-app created as part of the 100DDevs course curriculum (by MayanWolfe), but I have implemented numerous features and changes, adding another collection, modifying the models, and adapting the design. 

# Refactoring

I'm not pleased with the layout yet, as it's not working well on all screen sizes. I might use React or Tailwind in the future, but for now the most important thing is that it is adding/editing/deleting documents.
